An Image to PlayStation TIM File Converter

This tool converts almost any image file into a PlayStation TIM image file for PlayStation homebrew development. Uses the FreeImage library for loading image files of almost any file format.

# Features
- Uses the same argument format used in bmp2tim.
- Supports alpha channel (if available) with threshold control as transparency mask.
- Color-key and index-key transparency masking.
- RGB to color-index image conversion (currently very basic).
